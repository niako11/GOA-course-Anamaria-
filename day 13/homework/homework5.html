        <h1>ice cream</h1>
        <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener,<br>
             either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches.<br>
              Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and <br>
              stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured<br>
               cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). <br>
               It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>

            <b>Italian ice cream is gelato. Frozen custard is a type of rich ice cream. Soft serve is softer and is often served at<br>
                 amusement parks and fast-food restaurants in the United States. Ice creams made from cow's milk alternatives,<br>
                  such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, oat, cashew, coconut, almond milk, or tofu),<br>
                   are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.</b>

        <p>Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon,<br>
             or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by the hands as finger food.<br>
              Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an ingredient <br>
              in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked items such as Baked Alaska.</p>
              <i>Banana "nice cream"[a] is a 100% fruit-based vegan alternative.<br>
                 Frozen yoghurt, or "froyo", is similar to ice cream but uses yoghurt and can be lower in fat.<br>
                  Fruity sorbets or sherbets are not ice creams but are often available in ice cream shops.</i>
                  <u>The meaning of the name ice cream varies from one country to another.<br>
                     In some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom,[1][2] ice cream applies only to a specific variety,<br>
                      and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main<br>
                       ingredients, notably the amount of cream.[3] Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes<br>
                        labelled "frozen dairy dessert" instead.[4] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all <br>
                        variants.</u>
