         <h1>watermelon</h1>
         <p>Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit.<br> 
            A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties.<br>

            Watermelon is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its large edible fruit,<br>
             which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink,<br>
              with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking.<br>
               It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.<br>
            Kordofan melons from Sudan are the closest relatives and may be progenitors of modern,<br>
             cultivated watermelons.[2] Wild watermelon seeds were found in Uan Muhuggiag, a prehistoric site<br>
              in Libya that dates to approximately 3500 BC.[3] In 2022, a study was released that traced 6,000-year-old watermelon<br>
              seeds found in the Libyan desert to the Egusi seeds of Nigeria, West Africa.[4] Watermelons were domesticated in north-east<br>
               Africa and cultivated in Egypt by 2000 BC, although they were not the sweet modern variety. Sweet dessert watermelons spread<br>
                across the Mediterranean world during Roman times.[5]</p>

        <p>The watermelon is an annual that has a prostrate or climbing habit.<br>
             Stems are up to 3 metres (10 feet) long and new growth has yellow or brown hairs. <br>
             Leaves are 60 to 200 millimetres (2+1⁄4 to 7+3⁄4 inches) long and 40 to 150 mm (1+1⁄2 to 6 in) wide.<br>
              These usually have three lobes that are lobed or doubly lobed. Young growth is densely woolly with yellowish-brown<br>
               hairs which disappear as the plant ages. Like all but one species in the genus Citrullus, watermelon has branching tendrils.<br>
                Plants have unisexual male or female flowers that are white or yellow and borne on 40-millimetre-long (1+1⁄2 in) hairy stalks.<br>
                 Each flower grows singly in the leaf axils, and the species' sexual system, with male and female flowers produced on each plant,<br>
                  is monoecious. The male flowers predominate at the beginning of the season; the female flowers, which develop later, have inferior<br>
                   ovaries. The styles are united into a single column.[citation needed]

            The large fruit is a kind of modified berry called a pepo with a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center (mesocarp and endocarp).[7] Wild plants have fruits up to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter, while cultivated varieties may exceed 60 cm (24 in). The rind of the fruit is mid- to dark green and usually mottled or striped, and the flesh, containing numerous pips spread throughout the inside, can be red or pink (most commonly), orange, yellow, green or white.[8][9]</p>
