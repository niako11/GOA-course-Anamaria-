        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.<br>
             Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

            Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.<br>
             It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.<br>
              It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]</p>
