        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.<br>
             Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.<br>
              Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa,<br>
               the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football<br>
                (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football;<br>
                     and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known <br>
                     as "football codes".</p>

        <p>Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003,<br>
             winning the FA Cup in his first season. He went on to become a star player at United, as they won<br>
              three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; his 2007-08<br>
               season earned him his first Ballon d'Or, aged 23. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive<br>
                association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million).<br>
                 He was integral to Madrid becoming a dominant force again, as they won four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018,<br>
                  including La Décima. He won back-to-back Ballon d'Or awards in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was<br>
                   runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top <br>
                   goalscorer and finished as the Champions League's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018.<br>
                    With Madrid, Ronaldo's additional titles include two La Liga titles, including a record-breaking title win in 2011-12,<br>
                     and two Copas del Rey. In 2018, following issues with the Madrid hierarchy, Ronaldo made a surprise transfer to Juventus<br>
                      in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million). He won several trophies in Italy, including two Serie A <br>
                      titles and a Coppa Italia, and broke several records for Juventus. He returned to United in 2021; despite a <br>
                      collectively disappointing season, Ronaldo's individual performances earned him being included in the PFA Team of<br>
                       the Year at 37 years old.</p>

        <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.<br>
            [2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during<br>
             the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed<br>
              these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th<br>
              century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of<br>
               local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England,<br>
                becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of<br>
                 football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]</p>
